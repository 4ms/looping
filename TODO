Inf Hold does not work

Timing between loopclk out and actual audio loop is off a bit
-drifts over time: use a clock to play a sound repeatedly and 
	and also clock the LD with it. Set Time to x2.
	patch the sound once into the LD with FB at 100%
	Over time, the looped sound creeps ahead in time compared to the clock
	It's as if the loop is slighly shorter than 2x the actual clock
	Maybe creeps 0.1-0.2ms per loop for a .75s clock (1.5s loop) compared to Loop
	Clk out
	More erratic when compared to Clk Out


Distorts when at FB = 100%
